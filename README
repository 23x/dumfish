You need the following packages (on debian):
libconfig-inifiles-perl
libcrypt-blowfish-perl
libcrypt-cbc-perl

For Windows with ActivePerl you can find the packages here:
http://www.bribes.org/perl/ppm/
just ppm install http://path/to.ppd on a command line.
You need:
Crypt-CBC
Crypt-Blowfish
Config-IniFiles

maybe you need to patch the sourcecode too. feel free to send me a patch. I will happily ignore it.
